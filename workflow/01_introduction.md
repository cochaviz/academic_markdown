# Introduction

A long time ago, there was a boy, who, like all others in the land of academics
whished to create nicely formatted, accessible documents. As most people in the
land, he was forced to speak in LaTeX. And although he was first confused, he
eventually learned to love it.

The joy of simply reading through a document that looked professional,
sleek, dare one say _like a work of art_. "Who cares about content?", the boy
thought. And so he spent his days formatting, formatting, and formatting. And oh
how he formatted.

> _To the sound of 'my favorite things'_
>
> From tables, to templates, and tensors, to tokens.  
> And sections and headings, and figures, he opens.  
> Each one of these looks as best as can be.  
> Those are some of his favorite things.

Until one day, his deadline was due, he got into trouble. You see, as was _so_
meticulously formatting, and formatting, and formatting, he forgot to write!
Shock and terror overtook the boy, as it slowly dawned on him: "Who cares about
formatting?!".

---

That's right, who cares about formatting? Well, I won't lie, I do. But as I have
learned, it should not distract from the content. You might be surprised to hear
that the boy from the parable is me, and you might be even more surprised to
hear that no-one should care about formatting. "What?" Yes, wait, please bear
with me.

Let me rephrase: you should not care about formatting. As a writer, I have to
care about formatting, but it should never be your focus. Formatting exists
to support the message, but for the formatting to support your message, you
should have a good message in the first place. The reader, you, should not care
about formatting. The message should be the focus.

As writing the message should be the focus, why would we use tools riddled with
markup language when writing? Honestly, I don't know. There are many different
possibilities with regard to writing workflows, and I don't claim to know them
all. But I do have the feeling that not many of them involve raw text in a
distraction-free environment.

That is not to say I don't think they're useful. Languages such as the
TeX[^tex_language] provide incredibly detailed typesetting configurations.
Microsoft Word, regardless of its many shortcomings, provides a more intuitive
way for people to format their documents. The former has allows is more
malleable, while the latter is generally easier to use. But these are not
necessary for _writing_, rather they are necessary for typesetting.

My personal belief, however, is that your message should stand as independent
from your formatting as possible. Notwithstanding the importance of
accessibility, it should not matter whether your 'document' is a collection of
sheep with glyphs shaved in their wool, or a carefully type-set LaTeX document.
Although, the latter will probably smell significantly less.

I therefore want to urge anyone who is reading the following: Start writing in
plaintext. Literal _plain_ _text_. Not because it is easy to distribute, or
because it does not require any tools besides a text editor, or even because of
it is small size. Write in plain text because you will not be able to fool
yourself with anything but your own writing. Tools are a windows into the world;
when you are holding a hammer, everything suddenly looks 'hammerable'.

This starts to sound more like a manifesto and less like a manual or user-guide,
so I will slack on the opinions. I nevertheless hope I have at least motivated
my choice, and I hope to have at least made you think about your writing and its
efficacy. Which brings me, and you for that matter, to the part where I will
explain how _I_ practice what I preach, and how you can copy said practice.

[^tex_language]:
    It's actually a fully Turing-complete language. LaTeX is only a
    set of macros (i.e. functions) for the TeX language.
