# Academic Markdown - Tools and Guide

[![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/cochaviz/academic_markdown)

This repository contains my workflow for using markdown and `pandoc` for
academic writing and serves as a template for that workflow. If you're just
looking to try it out, press the green button that says _Use This Template_ and
open it in a codespace. Otherwise, continue reading to set up a more permanent
version of this environment.

In this README, you will find instructions on how to use `build.py` and the
provided `Dockerfile`. That is, how to set up your system to successfully build
markdown files to `pdf`, $\LaTeX$, `HTML`, and markdown (that is
Github-flavoured markdown with rendered citations).

In _Workflow_, I will show how I use this repository and VSCode in conjunction
with Zotero to write articles, surveys, etc. This is available in both
[pdf](./academic_markdown.pdf) and [markdown](./academic_markdown.md) format, of
which the source can be found in `src/`.

## Capabilities

For my writing, I wanted to be able to do the following things:

- Work locally (preferably VSCode).
- Write academic papers and reports (e.g. work with Zotero and create figures).
- Create $\LaTeX$, `markdown`, and pdf files.
- Focus on writing, not on markup.

My conclusion was that writing in markdown and using `pandoc` to export was the
way to go. This repository is my attempt at making a workflow that satisfies
these conditions. Furthermore, I hope to provide a foundation for people to
start exploring all these amazing tools that are available _for free_.

## Quick Start

To start, you can choose to:

- [Use the provided Dockerfile](https://www.docker.com/) to create a container
  in which the files are built (use the `--docker` flag).

- Install the required dependencies ([Python (3.11)](https://www.python.org/),
  [`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/),
  [`pandoc-crossref`](https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref), and
  [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.or/)) yourself.

- Open this template in a Github codespace (green button in the top-right of the
  repository).

- Open locally in a VSCode
  [devcontainer](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/cochaviz/academic_markdown).

If you are on Github, using codespaces is definitely the easiest if you'd just
like to have a look around. Be aware that this might take a while to set up
(about 2 minutes), but only needs to be done once.

### Building

When using VSCode, there are [Build
tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/tasks) that automate this
process _based on the currently opened file_. This is just a proxy for
`academic_markdown.py`, and can also be run manually.

In case you'd like to build manually, refer to the usage of
`academic_markdown.py` in the command line:

```txt
$ python academic_markdown.py --help
usage: build.py [-h] [--options OPTIONS] [--pandoc PANDOC] [--docker] [--log LOG] [--do-not-open] [--tectonic] source target

Wrapper for `pandoc` providing sensible defaults for rendering from pandoc-flavored markdown used in academic writing.

positional arguments:
  source             Source file or folder. In the case that the source is a single file, also mention the extension (your_file.md).
  target             Target output file, or extension (pdf, md, tex, etc.). Uses pandoc under the hood, so refer to their documentation for the options.

options:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --options OPTIONS  Additional options to pass through to pandoc.
  --pandoc PANDOC    Path to pandoc in case it cannot be provided through the PATH variable. Gets overridden if the --docker option is set.
  --docker           Use docker configuration to build, requires docker to be installed.
  --log LOG          Log level (ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG). Default is WARNING.
  --do-not-open      Do not open output in default code.
  --tectonic         Use tectonic when creating PDFs to install missing packages on the fly. Is ignored when docker is used.
```

For concrete example of how to use this, refer to the [VSCode
tasks](.vscode/tasks.json). Each of these tasks provides a different example of
how to use the script.

### Usage

Personally, I work a lot in VSCode meaning that this workflow is optimized for
use with that IDE in particular. All the required files and instructions,
however, are available in such a manner that this can be set up similarly with
any IDE.

#### Project Structure

I imagine two ways of writing which I have often encountered myself. The first,
is a situation in which you only need to write a small report. The second is a
situation where multiple files are required for that single final document to
avoid one incredibly large document.

```txt
├── academic_markdown.py
└── docs
    ├── my_report.md
    ├── bibliography.bib
    ├── images
    └── [metadata.yaml] // optional, preferrably use frontmatter
```

: Setup with a single file. Since all the information can be found in one file
(besides perhaps the bibliography), metadata.yaml is optional and frontmatter
can also be used. {#lst:single_file_setup}

```txt
├── academic_markdown.py
└── docs
    ├── 01_introduction.md
    ├── 02_methodology.md
    ├── 03_conclusion.md
    ├── bibliography.bib
    ├── images
    └── metadata.yaml
```

: Setup with multiple files. Here, `pandoc` would use the frontmatter of the
first document, if available, but I think the `metadata.yaml` should be
provided. This separates configurations from content in larger projects.
{#lst:multiple_file_setup}

When using `academic_markdown.py`, these situations are determined by the number
of files in the target folder. When there is only one, the first situation is
assumed, and `metadata.yaml` is optional. When there are more files, the second
situation is assumed, and `metadata.yaml` is required.

#### Integration with VSCode

#### Other IDEs

## Motivation

My reasoning is as follows: Markdown is a great format to write in but lacks
configurability. $\LaTeX$ is great for configurability, but rather hard to write
in (updates take quite a while to render, and the syntax is sometimes rather
distracting). One should focus on writing first, and then make small adjustments
where necessary. For this reason, I first write in Markdown and then convert to
PDF through $\LaTeX$. In case I would like to customize certain aspects of the
exported file, I export to $\LaTeX$ and then to pdf.

While all of this is supported by `pandoc`, finding a system to work with this
is not necessarily trivial. This repository should provide everything necessary
to make the above workflow as smooth as possible while still allowing for
personalization.

## Roadmap

- [x] **Dockerized Environment**. Lightweight dockerized environment that allows
      for a full replacement of `pandoc`. Also automatically downloads missing
      latex
      packages.

- [ ] **Predefined devcontainer**. This will prevent long waiting times for using
      a devcontainer both locally and in codespaces.

- [ ] **Github Actions for building**. Use GitHub Actions to automatically
      build to PDF/$\LaTeX$ according to user preferences. This could be useful
      for ensuring rendered documents are always up-to-date, and avoiding the
      necessity for local builds. Could, perhaps, also be faster than building
      locally and pushing.

- [ ] **Full Manual**. A complete and detailed explanation of how this workflow
      can be used. This should be an instruction for any person that would like
      to use markdown for serious writing. It should provide an introduction to
      `pandoc`, docker, and VSCode.

- [ ] **Independent VSCode Extension**. A VSCode extension, independent of
      `build.py`. This could be an improved user experience for existing VSCode
      users. This template should, however, still be as usable without VSCode.
